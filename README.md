An ad-free YouTube client built with Flutter. Watch YouTube videos without ads, subscribe to channels, retrieve video dislikes, read comments, save videos, and more.

> **Note:** This app was originally created for personal use. If it's not for you, that's fine - just don't use it. I've seen comments calling this a "NewPipe clone." Sure, if that's how you see it. But FluxTube is built with Flutter, supports multiple YouTube services (NewPipe Extractor, Piped, Invidious, Explode), and the whole point of having multiple backends is to keep the app working - if one service goes down, switch to another. If you actually care about improving it, open an issue. No offense.

## Features

- **No Login Needed**: Use the app without any login requirements.
- **Ad-Free Experience**: Enjoy YouTube videos without interruptions.
- **Multiple YouTube Services**: Switch between NewPipe Extractor, Piped, Invidious, or Explode backends.

## FluxTube vs NewPipe App

If you select "NewPipe Extractor" as your YouTube service in FluxTube, it uses the same [NewPipe Extractor](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor) library under the hood. So what's the difference?

|                             | FluxTube                                           | NewPipe App                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Framework**         | Flutter (cross-platform)                           | Native Android (Kotlin/Java)  |
| **Multiple Backends** | Yes (NewPipe Extractor, Piped, Invidious, Explode) | No (NewPipe Extractor only)   |
| **Fallback Options**  | Switch service if one breaks                       | Wait for app update           |
| **SponsorBlock**      | Built-in                                           | Requires fork (e.g., Tubular) |
| **Multiple Profiles** | Yes                                                | No                            |
| **Download**          | Yes (all services, with FFmpeg merging)            | Yes                           |
| **Background Play**   | Yes (with notification controls)                   | Yes                           |
| **System PiP**        | Yes (auto-enter on home press)                     | Yes                           |

**TL;DR:** FluxTube gives you options. If NewPipe Extractor stops working tomorrow, you can switch to Piped or Invidious and keep watching. NewPipe app is more feature-complete for downloading, but you're stuck with one backend. The UIs are different too.

## Recommended Settings

For the best experience:

| Use Case                                | YouTube Service    | Notes                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recommended**                   | NewPipe Extractor  | Direct extraction, most reliable, no instances needed |
| **When NewPipe Extractor breaks** | Piped or Invidious | Instance-based, switch if one goes down               |

> **Tip:** Click on  "Auto-Check Instances" in settings for automatic failover when an instance becomes unavailable.
